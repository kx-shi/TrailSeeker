# TrailSeeker
TrailSeeker is a web-application which displays information to the user about existing hiking trails. The data contains informaiton about real trails fetched from the Outdooractive API (link).

The trails displayed include information such as name of the trail, location, length, etc. Using the application, you can easily find trails suitable for you. We hope that it will lower the threshold to go out and enjoy nature, promote outdoor activity, and increase awareness of the importance of our environment.
